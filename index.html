          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>An aspiring junior web developer with a background in 3D animation. A word I always say is "wow" so my goal is to make cool things that can make others go "wow".</p>
          <p>I have a passionate interest in all things techie without being nerdy. Can repair phones, build my own computers, an avid computer gamer and love trying to figure out weird and wacky problems. </p>
          <p>I have just finished General Assembly's web development course. I have been extremely amused over everything I've had the opportunity to learn, explore and lay my hands on (I've already lost count of amount of times I've suddenly wowed in the middle of class)! Check out the stuff I've made and feel free to hit me up! </p>

              <ul>
                <li>Implemented user permissions on three levels: admin, users and people who aren’t registered </li>
                <li>Users able to see all of our bike stands and their locations on a map using geolocation.</li>
                <li>Able to see all of our bikes and whether they are available to rent or not.</li>
                <li>Able to rent a bike, return a bike and pay with a credit card through Stripe, cost is calculated for them based on the number of hours they’ve rented the bike for.</li>
                <li>Time/date validations for renting and returning bikes (i.e. can’t rent a bike in the past). </li>
                <li>We have a bike inventory that tracks which station the bikes are rented and returned to. </li>
                <li>Users have access to their rental history which is a record of all the bikes that they’ve rented in the past.</li>

              <ul>
                <li>At the moment if the user presses the close button on the payments page, it will still register as them having returned the bike. Will probably need a redirect and cancel return if the payment doesn’t go through successfully.</li>
                <li>Integrate with React.</li>
                <li>Make the site responsive and accessible.</li>
                <li>Wanted to implement a bike live tracking feature so being able to see the bike’s locations on a map. Which would possibly mean changing our models around to centre around the bike. We didn’t centre our models and relationships around the bike because we didn’t have a bike or anything else that we could pull data from.</li>
                <li>Feature for users to report damaged bikes/bikes needing repairs. </li>

              <p>Environmental Simulation Done in THREE.js. I wanted very much to apply some of my existing skills to what I'm doing now. But through some research I've discovered that others would prefer to import models from exisiting 3D applications I took on the challenge to try to 'model' with code. The result is this procedurally generated environment using purely code.</p>
